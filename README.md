# Binary-Search
This program will search a integer number from a dynamic array of user given size. 

#Description

Program will search a number from user given size dynamiclly array and this search is binary search.
and for sorting array this program have three sorted functions:
#1)Linear-Sorting
#2)Selection-Sorting
#3)Bubble-Sorting

#Binary-Search
In computer science, binary search, also known as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, 
is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.

#Linear-Sort
Sorting is any process of arranging items systematically, and has two common, yet distinct meanings: 
ordering: arranging items in a sequence ordered by some criterion; categorizing: grouping items with similar properties.

#Selection-Sort
selection sort is a sorting algorithm, specifically an in-place comparison sort. It has O time complexity, making it 
inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort.

#Bubble-Sort
Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list,
compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.
